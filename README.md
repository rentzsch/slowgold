# JREnum

Original [idea](https://twitter.com/benedictC/status/277867522869571584) and [implementation](https://gist.github.com/4246759) by [Benedict Cohen](http://benedictcohen.co.uk).

JREnum is a macro that automates creation of functions that blast enums from boring primitive compile-time-land to the fun-filled party environment of runtime.

Let's use a concrete example. Instead of writing:

	typedef enum {
	    Stream_Disconnected,
	    Stream_Connecting,
	    Stream_Connected,
	    Stream_Disconnecting
	}   StreamState;

write:

	JREnum(StreamState,
	       Stream_Disconnected,
	       Stream_Connecting,
	       Stream_Connected,
	       Stream_Disconnecting);

This will generate the previous `typedef enum` and will also generate a corresponding suite of functions:

**NSString\* StreamStateToString(int value)**

Given a value, will return the enum's string representation. For example `StreamStateToString(2)` would return `@"Stream_Connecting"`.

When confronted with values not defined in the enumeration, this function will return a placeholder string explaining the situation. For example `StreamStateToString(2000)` would return `@"<unknown StreamState: 2000>"`.

**BOOL StreamStateFromString(NSString \*enumLabel, StreamState \*enumValue)**

Attempts to return the enum's `int` value given its label. For example `StreamStateFromString(@"Stream_Disconnecting", &value)` would return `YES` and set `value` to `3`.

This function returns `NO` if the label for the enum type is unknown. For example `StreamStateFromString(@"lackadaisical", &value)` would return `NO` and leave `value` untouched.

**NSDictionary\* StreamStateByValue()**

Returns a dictionary whose keys are the enum's values. Used by StreamStateToString().

When enums have multiple overlapping values, the current implementation exhibits last-write-wins behavior.

**NSDictionary\* StreamStateByLabel()** 

Returns a dictionary whose keys are the enum's labels. Used by StreamStateFromString(). This is the function you want if you wish to enumerate an enum's labels and values at runtime.

## Split Header / Source Files

JREnum() is fine for when you have an enum that lives solely in an .m file. But if you're exposing an enum in a header file, you'll have to use the alternate macros. In your .h, use JREnumDeclare():

	JREnumDeclare(StreamState,
	              Stream_Disconnected,
	              Stream_Connecting,
	              Stream_Connected,
	              Stream_Disconnecting);

And then use JREnumDefine() in your .m:

	JREnumDefine(StreamState);

## Explicit Values

You can also explicitly define enum integer values:

	JREnum(StreamState,
	       Stream_Disconnected = 42,
	       Stream_Connecting,
	       Stream_Connected,
	       Stream_Disconnecting);

In the above scenario, `Stream_Disconnected`'s value will be `42`, `Stream_Connecting`'s will be `43` and so on.

JREnum currently only supports integer explicit values (bit shifts and masks won't work). Patches welcome.
